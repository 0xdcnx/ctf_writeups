Writeups for bandit challenges

I've already solved all the bandit challenges before. The goal here is to practice writing writeups (...is that even a sentence?), so that later I can recall my thought process. Plus, I saw John Hammond solving these with python, I can use that aproach to practice my scripting skills with python.
